**Project Objectives:**

A small set of cross platform classes and functions that will allow the quick development of applications.

**Designed for ease of use:**

- Simply include the needed files in your project.
  No need to build the classes as a separate libraries (release + debug version) and then link the library with your code
- Self test routines on most units.   
- Implemented in header-only files whenever possible.

**Operating system compatibility:**

Already tested under:
- Windows 32, 64 bit
- OSX 10.6+
- Future compatibility: IOS

**Project status:**

Gathering and cleaning up of classes.
The classes are currently integral parts of my other cross platform software.
The classes will be cleaned of unneeded binding code and added in this space.
Doxygen documentation will be added in the files.

Classes in the current queue:
[ok] portable fileSystem
[ok] portable log file
[ok] portable INI-like persistence class
[ok] portable screensaver API class
[ok] Listener pattern
[ok] Gui drawing tools (HDC: Ok, NSView [Ok], NSImage [ ], NSBmpRepresentation [ ]
